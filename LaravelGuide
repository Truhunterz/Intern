1. Setting Up Your Environment
Before you can start using Laravel, you need to set up your development environment.

A. Install PHP and Composer
PHP: Make sure you have PHP installed. Laravel requires PHP 8.0 or higher.

Composer: Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. Laravel uses Composer to manage its dependencies.

You can download Composer from getcomposer.org.

B. Set Up a Local Server
You can use XAMPP (which includes Apache, MySQL, and PHP) or another similar tool like MAMP or WAMP. 
This will allow you to run PHP applications locally.

Alternatively, you can use Laravel Homestead (a Vagrant box) or 
Laravel Sail (a Docker-based development environment) for more advanced setups.




2. Creating a New Laravel Project
Once your environment is ready, you can create a new Laravel project.


A. Install Laravel via Composer
<!--no. 1 Bash--!>
//Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt to create a new Laravel project:

composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel project-name

//Replace project-name with the name of your project.


B. Navigate to Your Project Directory
<!--no. 2 Bash--!>

cd project-name

C. Serve the Application
<!--no. 3 Bash--!>
//To start a local development server, run:

php artisan serve

//This command will start a local server at http://localhost:8000. 
//You can visit this URL in your web browser to see the default Laravel welcome page.




3. Understanding Laravel's Directory Structure
Laravel has a specific directory structure, and understanding it is crucial for working with the framework:

app/: Contains the core code of your application, including models, controllers, and middleware.

config/: Contains configuration files.

database/: Contains database migrations and seeders.

resources/: Contains views (Blade templates), raw assets (CSS, JS), and language files.

routes/: Contains route definitions.

public/: The entry point for web requests; contains the index.php file and public assets like images, CSS, and JavaScript.




4. Creating Routes, Controllers, and Views
Now that you have a basic understanding of Laravel, let's create a simple route, controller, and view.

<!--no. 1 PHP (Define a Route)--!>
//Open routes/web.php and add a new route:

Route::get('/greeting', function () {
    return 'Hello, World!';
});

//Now, visiting http://localhost:8000/greeting will display "Hello, World!".


<!--no. 2 bash (Create a Controller)--!>
//You can create a new controller using Artisan (Laravel's command-line tool):

php artisan make:controller GreetingController

//This will create a new controller in app/Http/Controllers/.


<!--no. 3 PHP (Define a Controller Method)--!>
//Open app/Http/Controllers/GreetingController.php and define a method:

namespace App\Http\Controllers;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class GreetingController extends Controller
{
    public function show()
    {
        return view('greeting');
    }
}


<!--no. 4 HTML (Create a View)--!>
//Create a new Blade view file in resources/views/ named greeting.blade.php:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Greeting</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, Laravel!</h1>
</body>
</html>


<!--no. 5 PHP (Update the Route)--!>
//Now, link the route to the controller method:

use App\Http\Controllers\GreetingController;

Route::get('/greeting', [GreetingController::class, 'show']);

//Now, visiting http://localhost:8000/greeting will display the "Hello, Laravel!" message from your Blade view.
